Data Preprocessing:
1-Import data to Jupyter notebook.
2-Seen the basic structure and Statistics for all columns for both categorical and integer.
3-Do some exploratory data analysis(EDA) and Visualization. univariate distribution, bivarirate distribution.
4-Find insight from data by grouping and aggregation, crosstab, pivot table, etc.
5-And after that working with mission values(Data mungling)
6-Add some new neccessary feature to data set to find more insight from data such as-Embarked, Fare, Age.
7-Replaced all missing values with most appropriate method with visualization.
8-Then Working with outliers age attribute, Fare attributes.
9-Finaly did feature engineering on data set such as- Label encoding, One-hot encoding, make dummy variables.
10-Remove extra and uneccesary columns to the dataframe and save the processed dataframe to csv file.


Model Training
1-Train model with several algorithms after that. 
2-The most fitted model is LinearDescriminentAnalysis which gives 83.5% accuracy.
3-Also campare all models.
4-Predict values from test dataframe
5-Get the infomation about candidates who probably were survived.
6-Finaly save the model for further modification and use purpose.
